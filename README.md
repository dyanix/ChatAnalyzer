# WhatsApp Chat Analyzer

A web application built using Streamlit that allows users to analyze WhatsApp chat data. Users can upload a WhatsApp chat export file, preprocess the data, and then view various analyses such as the total number of messages, media shared, links shared, and a monthly timeline. The app also provides visualizations such as daily timeline, activity map, weekly activity map, most busy users, wordcloud, and the most common words used in the chat. The app allows users to select a specific user to analyze or see overall statistics for the group chat.
